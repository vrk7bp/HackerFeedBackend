Things we want this algorithm to do:

	1. Identify Users that have similar interests and tastes
		Identifying interests and tastes 
			1. aricles read - if people have read similar articles, they have similar interests
			2. Types of posts - Self Posts (Show HN, Ask HN) or links
			3. Content of article - via keyword search
				- can create artificial partitions - ie tech, langs, health, ect ...
			4. Hosting of the article - ie TechCrunch, Wired, ect ...
	2. Push articles to these users based on articles read by users with similar interests
		1. Have a set of all articles read by Users in this group in the past <some time period>
		2. Always
		
		
Information Associated with each user
	
	1. List of articles currently <ie less than 1 week old> read
	2. Common sites visited (ie top 5 or 10 or w/e)
	3. Interests (ie common keywords, again top 5 or 10 or ...)
	4. Current group they are associated with (via some ID)
	5. Some score or coherence value in that group - to evaluate if they need to be swapped
	
	For new members, keep them in a newbie group untill they have enough info to properly catagorize?
